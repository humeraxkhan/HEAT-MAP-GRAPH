# HEAT-MAP-GRAPH
To create a heatmap in Python using scikit-learn and seaborn, you can follow these steps:

    Import Libraries: Use pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for creating the heatmap, and matplotlib for plotting.
    Load Data: Load your dataset, such as the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
    Compute Correlation Matrix: Use pandas to calculate the correlation matrix of your data.
    Create the Heatmap: Use seaborn's heatmap function to visualize the correlation matrix. Customize it with options like annot=True for displaying correlation values and cmap='coolwarm' for color mapping.

This process helps visualize the relationships between different features in your dataset.
